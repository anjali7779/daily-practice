the response object can be used to send a response for the current HTTP request

    // open http response code in this link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status

    // for status code we are using writeHead() and infect of end() we can also use write() but the key difference is that the end() method send that with response end here and write will not tell request that please stop this request we got the result that we want.and if we dont end() then that will be taks too much load

    // and much extra features if we want to put html content in this we can simply put content-type = text/html
